1.2 Reformat place labels
      Adjust size of place name, remove some labels

2.1 Added buttons to toggle different layers
      (to do!) Seperate "Case Study Sites", "Students and Teaching Team" and other layers, into two rows.

      Need TA to reformat students info. by checking https://openweathermap.org/
      For location, use {City,Country} format, and make sure the location is searchable in this website. For example, "Charlottesville,VA" is incorrect, we need to change it to "Charlottesville,US" (use no space)

      (to do!) change cursor to a pointer when the mouse is over the places.
